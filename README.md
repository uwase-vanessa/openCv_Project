# OpenCV Rectangle Drawing Script

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to manipulate an image by adding shapes, text, and applying visual effects.

## Features
- Reads an input image (`assignment-001-given.jpg`).
- Draws a green rectangle around a specified region.
- Adds a semi-transparent black shadow behind a text label.
- Displays the modified image in a window.
- Saves the resulting image as `result.jpg`.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`cv2`)

## Setup
1. Install OpenCV:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
